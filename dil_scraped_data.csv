  Important Notes to Students
Please install python3 and Anaconda to your laptop before the first lecture. Bring your laptop and power cable to each class.
If your first intention is learning Python, please start TODAY. There are so many free online-resources. For example, there is a series of videos showing use of Python 3 (These videos dont use Juptyer Notebooks though). Similarly, there are online courses offered on Python from University of Michigan. Another one provides a very nice list of Python tutorials and annotated analyses.
There are also several free (open-source) textbooks and websites on coding Python 3. Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and Learning to Program with Python by Halterman are just two examples. Some resources teach Python with a special focus on data science (i.e. Python Data Science Handbook), exploratory data analysis (i.e. Think Stats), and modeling (i.e. Modeling and Simulation in Python).
About Python Packages: There are more than 100k packages. In this course, we will mainly use the following modules:
Pandas: data manipulation and analysis
Numpy: fundamental package for numerical computing
Matplotlib basic plotting library
Seaborn statistical data visualization
Statsmodels: statistical modeling, tests, and data exploration
The other packages very useful for data science include
Scipy: fundamental package for scientific computing
Plotly interactive plotting library
Scikit-learn: machine learning
PyTorch Torch based machine learning
NLTK natural language processing
Pillow: image analysis and manipulation
BeautifulSoup: pulling data out of HTML and XML files
Scrapy: web-crawling
Dask: Parallel computing with task scheduling

Courses,https://dil.umbc.edu/courses/what-classes-should-i-take-in-the-upcoming-semester/,What classes should I take in the upcoming semester?,"In order to get your MPS degree, you need to take the 7 core data science courses (DATA 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, and 607) and 3 elective courses.
I AM A NEW STUDENT. WHAT CLASSES SHOULD I TAKE?
if you are familiar with Python programming, fundamentals of statistics, and linear algebra, then
Start with DATA 601 (Introduction to Data Science) since many other courses build upon the concepts presented in this foundational course.
If you want to take another DATA course with DATA 601, then please consider taking DATA 604 Data Management or DATA 605 Ethical and Legal Issues in Data Science.
If you know how to program in an object-oriented programming language different than Python, then please consider taking Data 690 Special Topics: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (DSAP) in your first semester. DSAP is a purely online class. You might like to take Data 605 Ethical and Legal Issues in Data Science andor DATA 607 Leadership in Data Science.
If you dont have serious programming experience, then please take Data 690 Special Topics: Statistical Analysis and Visualization with Python (Stats and Viz) in your first semester. This course is designed for students who have no or very minimal python programming experience. The other course you might like to take in your first semester is either DATA 605 or DATA 607. If you are an international student, then please take both Data 605 and DATA 607.
There is another course (DATA 690 Special Topics: Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning) designed to help our students who need to refresh their knowledge in Linear Algebra. This course starts with basic matrix operations in Python and covers subjects like vector calculus, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, and optimization. Note that we dont offer this course every semester!
Note that all the DATA 690 courses are counted towards your degree.
WHEN SHOULD I TAKE DATA 602, DATA 603, and DATA 606?
If you are familiar with data analysis and machine learning or if you have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or Information Systems, you can take DATA 602 concurrently with DATA 601 but if it is not the case, then please take 602 after taking 601.
If you already are familiar with big data platforms, you can take DATA 603 even in your first semester. Otherwise, please take it after completing DATA 601.
If you are taking one or two courses per semester, then please consider taking DATA 603 after taking DATA 602.
Additionally, you can only take DATA 606 (Capstone Project in Data Science) after completing your other required DATA courses  most students take that course in their final year but are thinking about potential research topics long before then.
Beyond those simple guidelines, below is some additional advising information for you to consider  save for future reference during your time with us.
WHY DO SOME COURSE TIMES ARE LISTED AS TBA (HOW CAN I REGISTER WITHOUT KNOWING THE DATE  TIME OF THE CLASS?
If Date and Time are announced as TBA, then it means that it will be an asynchronous class. In other words, there wont be any live lectures.
WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY COURSES WITH THE SAME CODE: DATA 690?
DATA 690 is the general code for all the special topics courses, which cover emerging or specialized Data Science topics on an as-needed basis.
Currently, there are three groups of special topics courses:
Foundational Data Science Courses (Examples: Stats and Viz with Python, Math Foundations of Machine Learning, DSAP)
Applications of Data Science (Example: Designing Data-Driven Web Applications and Applications of Machine Learning in Finance). Prerequisite: DATA 601.
Advanced Data Science Courses (Examples: Modern Practical Deep Learning, Intro to NLP, and AI for Practitioners). DATA 602 is a prerequisite of advanced data science courses. You cant take these courses before completing DATA 602!
The maximum number of Data 690 courses you can take during your graduate study is 6.
You can take three of these Data 690 courses to satisfy the 30-credits (10 courses) requirement of your masters degree.
HOW MANY CLASSES SHOULD I TAKE?
Graduate-level courses are not the same as the ones you probably took as an undergraduate student and likely will be more challenging. There is a higher degree of research, reading, writing, and group work involved in most of our courses. Certainly, some courses may be or seem harder than others, but how hard they may be for you is entirely dependent on how much time and effort you put into them andor your prior background or knowledge. As such, that means we cant tell you which courses are harder than others or which ones will require more work from you, since everyones preparation, schedule, tolerances, and capabilities are different.
International Students: If it is not their last semester, then the international students must take at least 3 courses in the Fall and Spring semesters. Only one of these courses can be online. The others have to be either an in-person or a hybrid class. These two rules do not apply to Summer semesters and the final semester of graduate study.
Domestic Students: Most DATA students start off with 1 or 2 courses in their first semester to see how things go, which is good for recent college graduates or those returning to school later in their careers. In fact, taking 2 courses while working full-time is the norm. If youre not working full-time, we are comfortable with a student taking 3 courses. However, taking 3 or more graduate courses in a semester will likely present problems if youre also working full-time so doing that is not advised unless absolutely necessary and would be done at your own academic risk.
Remember, UMBC policy requires you to maintain a 3.0 or higher cumulative GPA to graduate!
WHERE CAN I FIND THE LIST OF PATHWAY COURSES?
You can find the list of pathways and courses you can take here. Note that some of these courses are not available in all semesters."
Courses,https://dil.umbc.edu/courses/donttakescourses_equivalents/,Do Not Take Courses and Equivalents,"If you take DATA 605 Ethical  Legal Issues in Data Science, then do not take other programs ethics classes, for example
CYBR 623  Cybersecurity Law and Policy
ENMG 656  Engineering Law and Ethics
SENG 601  Ethics in Software Engineering
HIT 664  Health IT Law and Ethics
ENTR 603  Legal and Ethical Issues for Entrepreneurs
because of the serious amount of overlap between DATA 605 and these courses. On the other hand, if you cant find a seat in DATA 605, then you can take either of these classes as an equivalent. If you do that, please send an email to your advisor, so that your advisor can put a note in your records.
Similarly, if you take DATA 607 Leadership in Data Science then
ENMG 652 Management, Communication, and Leadership,
BTEC 665  Management, Leadership, and Communication
ENTR 602  Leadership and Communications
because of the serious amount of overlap between DATA 607 and these courses. On the other hand, if you cant find a seat in DATA 607, then you can take either of these classes as an equivalent. If you do that, please send an email to your advisor, so that your advisor can put a note in your records.
If you want to take 300-400 level courses to enhance your knowledge in fundamental subjects, you can do that but these courses wont be counted towards your MPS degree. The courses you can take should have either 600- or 700-level codes."
Courses,https://dil.umbc.edu/should-i-try-to-graduate-in-one-year/,Should I try to graduate in one year?,"This page is created specifically for our  students who ask for my advice regarding their time at UMBC.
Every semester, we get some students who want to take 4 courses in the Fall and Spring semesters and 2 in the summer and graduate in 12 months.
Is it doable? Yes, it is doable. Is it a good idea? It depends on your experience level!
If you have no prior experience in data science, if you have no prior experience in the industry, then you might experience difficulty landing your first job. This is true whether you finish our program in 12 months or in 24 months. However, if you dont rush to graduate, then you will have more time to build your portfolio, network and make connections with locals, improve your language skills (both English and programming), prepare for your interviews, etc.
The other thing you should remember is that the graduate courses are not like undergraduate courses in terms of time and effort required to be successful.  We cover lots of subjects in a 2.5-hour-long lecture but becoming proficient in applying those learnings to various types of data science projects and problems would require tens of hours of work and practice every week! So when you take one extra graduate class, you need to understand that you add 15 hours of work to your schedule.
Last but not least, finding a job requires a lot of time. Job search, tweaking your cover letter and resume for different jobs, doing research for the companies that you apply for, preparing for interviews, going through several interview cycles, etc. When you do this 442 or 424 course load plan, you might not have enough time for a successful job search.
One thing our international students should remember is that the timing is crucial when it comes to dealing with visa-related issues. You can apply for an OPT 90 days before you graduate. If you have a job offer, thencongratulationsit is better for you to apply as early as possible. However, if you dont have an offer yet, then you better spend more time on your job search. Do not forget that If you cannot find a job within 90 days of the start of your OPT, then you must make plans to depart the US immediately or change to some other status in the US. 90 days of unemployment is for the entire OPT period.
Hence rushing to graduate might put you in a disadvantageous position. Think twice!"

AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/pathways-and-certificates/,Pathways and Certificates,"PLEASE READ ME FIRST

As listed below, we have partnerships with various departments so that you can take elective courses on various subjects. We call those course-sets “pathways”. Electives are offered regularly – some are offered every semester, while others are rotated throughout the year. A common question is “which course should I take?” — unfortunately, we can’t really answer that with certainty since your choice of courses is entirely dependent on your own background, capabilities, desires or professional needs.

Even though it is recommended, you don’t have to choose your 3 electives from the same pathway. Some pathways are only available at one campus (either at the main campus or Shady Grove campus). For example, Spatial Analytics courses are only offered at the Shady Grove Campus. Computer Science (CMSC) and Information System (IS) courses are offered only at the main campus and most of those courses are taught during the daytime (before 5 pm).

Some electives have pre-requisites and not every elective is appropriate for every student. Therefore, be sure to read the Notes/Comments section in the course registration system to ensure you meet any listed academic or practical pre-requisites — and especially if you are taking a CMSC or an IS course as an elective. Also note that electives outside of DATA (in particular, from CMSC or IS) may meet multiple times during the week and/or during the day, which may not fit into your schedule. You can also learn more about graduate courses and their prerequisites at Graduate Catalog.

You are not limited to only taking DATA-listed courses as electives, but graduate courses (600-level and higher) that you select from other programs or departments as electives must be related to your DATA degree program and the pathway you choose. If you are unsure if a given elective course is applicable and will count toward your degree requirements, feel free to check with your Data Science Graduate Program Director (GPD) before registering for it. For CMSC electives, we strongly suggest contacting the professor in advance to determine your suitability and/or qualifications for their courses, including having the appropriate academic or professional prerequisites. In fact, if in doubt about your suitability for a course, it’s always good to check with the instructor (or GPD) ahead of time — just to be safe.

To locate electives from other programs, visit the graduate course catalog located at the Graduate School website. While you are free to take relevant electives from other programs, to ensure you are meeting the goals of the DATA program, if you wish to take electives not listed on our “pathway course lists”, contact the GPD first.

SPECIAL TOPICS IN DATA SCIENCE (DATA 690): You may take multiple “Special Topics” as electives — however, the topic of each Special Topics course must be different for it to count towards your degree.

UMBC can accept up to 6 relevant graduate credits toward the DATA MPS provided they have not been used as part of other earned degrees and were a “B” grade or higher. You will need to submit the course description and syllabus along with the Graduate School form requesting the transfer credit. For more details

Main campus students should email datascience-mps@umbc.edu
Shady Grove students should email sgprofessionalprograms@umbc.edu

GRADES

The following symbols are used for grades: A, B, C, D, F, and I.
D and F are not passing grades.
“I” means incomplete!
Because graduate students must maintain an overall ‘B’ average, every credit hour of ‘C’ in coursework must be balanced by a credit hour of ‘A.’
A course in which a grade less than ‘B’ is received may be repeated. On the transcript, ‘R’ (Repeated) denotes a repeated course. Only the grade on the repeated courses, whether it is higher or lower than the original grade, is used in the computation of the cumulative GPA; however, all grades earned remain on the transcript.
You must have a B or higher in all certificate courses to earn the certificate and must maintain a B average to graduate with the MPS degree.
If you fail a core class (DATA 601-7), you need to retake it but don’t forget you can’t it for the third time!

 

SEMESTERS/SCHEDULING

As with most universities, our ‘primary’ semesters are Fall and Spring. For the DATA program, we do not run courses over Winter Session since it is too short a timeframe for most students (and our adjunct faculty) to commit to attending class 3-4 times a week for a month. However, we do run courses over the summer — but which ones and which summer session(s) they are offered are dependent on instructor availability, so there may or may not be courses of interest, necessary for your degree progression, or that fit your schedule during summertime. It depends on what is offered and when. Of course, if courses are added to the schedule after registration opens — for any semester or session – we announce them by the DATA student email list.

TIME-TO-COMPLETE

Since international students are required to take 3 courses every Fall and Spring semester (unless it is their last semester at UMBC), they generally finish our program in 16 months (i.e. Start September 202X, Graduation: December 202X+1).

However, working professionals generally take 2 courses per semester due to their already busy schedules and they generally complete their degrees in approximately 2 years.

Most Certificate students complete their certificates in two semesters.

ADA REQUIREMENTS

Any ADA or documented special needs must be brought to your professor’s attention during the first week of the semester, and proper university/medical documentation must be provided. Retroactive accommodations may not be accepted.

RESEARCH & WRITING

As both graduate students and professionals, you will be expected to produce written deliverables that are appropriate for your classroom experience and profession or industry. Therefore, if you think you need assistance with developing and/or “brushing up” on graduate-level research and/or writing skills, UMBC offers a range of resources to help you obtain or polish those critical skills to enable you to succeed fully. If needed, I encourage you to take advantage of these campus resources — they’re here for your benefit:

PROMISE & Professional Development

Introducing the Graduate Student & Postdoctoral Development (GSPD) Unit

The unit responsible for providing professional development opportunities to our graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will now be known as the “Graduate Student & Postdoctoral Development” unit (GSPD). This name reflects our commitment to serving the diverse needs of our graduate student and postdoctoral scholar communities more comprehensively.

The GSPD unit will provide professional development for all graduate students and postdocs. We are so fortunate to have scholars from various backgrounds, countries of origin, cultures, life experiences and disciplinary frameworks.  Many of our workshops will be cross-cutting and of interest to our general population, such as those on financial literacy, public speaking, career exploration and time management.  While our programming will be open to all graduate students and postdocs, we will sometimes designate sessions as having an affiliation with a particular program within GSPD:

1. **PROMISE** – Programming for graduate students & postdocs from underserved backgrounds.  We are dedicated to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion within our graduate student and postdoctoral population and providing a “third space” for minoritized scholars. Building on a 20 year legacy of PROMISE programming at UMBC, the GSPD unit will continue to offer and expand upon PROMISE offerings, ensuring that scholars receive the support and resources they need to holistically excel.

2. **CIRTL (the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning)** –  Programming to enhance teaching effectiveness. UMBC scholars will enjoy free workshops and courses through the CIRTL national network as well as local innovative teaching and learning opportunities we are fostering with on-campus and off-campus partners. CIRTL empowers our graduate students and postdocs to excel as educators and mentors and earn nationally recognized certificates along the way.  Following the practice of the Faculty Development Center, we will designate sessions that count toward a CIRTL certificate with a “Ͼ” symbol.

3. **Office of Postdoctoral Affairs** – Programming, advocacy and support that acknowledges the unique needs of Postdoctoral Research Associates. The Office of Postdoctoral Affairs will focus on providing resources, guidance, and support for hiring and sustaining our postdoctoral scholars. Our goal is to foster a vibrant and collaborative community among postdoctoral researchers at our institution and support faculty in hiring and mentoring these scholars effectively.

The GSPD unit is committed to nurturing the growth and success of our diverse academic community. You are welcome to peruse our Fall 2023 Professional Development Calendar (events are also in our myUMBC group). In the coming weeks, you can expect to see updates to promotional materials and communication channels to reflect this change. Our MyUMBC group URL has been changed to https://my3.my.umbc.edu/groups/gspd; please update departmental websites to reflect the change. We encourage you to explore the enhanced offerings provided by the GSPD unit and take advantage of the resources available to support your students’ and postdocs academic and professional journey."

Some Tips

Finding your first internship or job might be easier than you think if you play the game right. Here are our general suggestions for our students.

Create a professional LinkedIn account with all the necessary information. Add your faculty and classmates to your network. Expand your network gradually. Be active on LinkedIn. Share things related to data science on a regular basis.
Create a GitHub account if you haven’t done so and build your portfolio which demonstrates all your important data skills and experiences.
Create a 1-page killer resume (with a clear objective, education history, relevant course load, list of sample projects, links to LinkedIn profile and GitHub accounts, programming/data science experience/skills/tools, etc.)
Network with classmates who work in the fields of data science/it/cs.
Attend local data science meetup events and workshops, but don’t be quiet, ask smart questions, and try to mingle with attendees, organizers, and speakers. Invite them to your LinkedIn network.
Participate in hackathons, Kaggle competitions, or other types of competitions organized by local companies.
Participate in UMBC career fairs and workshops.
Actively search for opportunities on LinkedIn, indeed.com, monster.com, etc.
If you are invited for an interview after you find a job/internship, accept that invitation and interview with them. With each interview, you’ll improve your interviewing skills while expanding your knowledge and network."
AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/graduate-graders-tutors/,Graduate Graders/Tutors,"Every semester, we hire a few MPS Data Science students as graduate graders/tutors (GGTs). In order to be considered for a GGT position, you need to complete Data 601, 602, 603, and 604 and formally apply through this page.

A formal application through the link below is the only thing you need to be considered for a GGT position, provided that you fulfill all eligibility criteria. You do not need any recommendation from a faculty member for your application to be considered. Please note that sending personal emails to our faculty members including the directors will not enhance your chances for receiving a GGT position!

The eligibility conditions stated above are the necessary conditions, but are not sufficient. This means that there is no guarantee to receive a GGT position even if you fulfill all the criteria! We have only a very limited number of positions and the number of applications we receive typically far exceeds the number of available positions. We do our best to conduct the selection process for the GGT positions as fair as possible. For this reason, we will not entertain any personal requests in the selection process.

Note that new students are NOT eligible to apply for GGT positions.

If you are going to have an internship next semester, then please do not apply for a GGT position.

If the next semester is going to be your last semester at UMBC and if you are going to take only one class, then please do not apply for GGT. Having a full-time internship or job-search should be your number one priority.

The final selection for the fall semester is made in August and for the spring semester in January. Students who are chosen for our GGT positions will be notified accordingly.

AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/academic-conduct/,Academic Conduct,"Homework Assignments, Projects, and Academic Conduct

In all data science graduate classes, all the homework assignments and programming projects must be completed by your own individual effort unless it is a group project/assignment. You should never have a copy of someone else’s solution/project (in part or in whole) either on paper or electronically under any circumstance. Also, you should never give a copy of your solution/project, either on paper or electronically, to another student. Unless it is expressed explicitly, this also means that you cannot “work” on the solution/project together. Cases of academic dishonesty will be dealt with severely.

Thus, you should:

Understand that having someone else’s project (even a small part) in your possession, even briefly, is considered cheating.
Understand that you can use AI tools for
Spell or grammar checking and correcting those mistakes in the things that you write,
Summarizing what you wrote
Fixing the bug in the code you wrote

is fine but asking AI tools to create content/code/report/essay for you and submitting it with some modifications as if it was your production is considered cheating.

Safeguard your account password; you are responsible for the actions of anyone else you may allow logging into your account.
Safeguard hard copies of your programs; excuses such as “I must have left a copy of my code in the lab where someone else must have found it” will not be accepted.
If you need help with your assignment/project, please see your instructor or our graduate tutors.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of Academic Integrity violations:

Emailing code in whole or in part
Instant Messaging code in whole or in part
Posting or obtaining code in whole or in part on the web, including but not limited to forums and newsgroups
Not taking the appropriate measures to protect your source code, including:
Placing your code in a public directory
Failing to lock your screen when away from your computer
Allowing someone to copy code from your monitor
Giving your password to another student

The following behaviors are not Academic Integrity violations and are, in fact, encouraged:

Asking a fellow student how they approached a problem
Brainstorming with fellow students
Helping a fellow student locate a bug in their code
Getting help with your code from an Instructor or a graduate tutor.

Your solution project will be checked for similarities with all other student solutions/projects. If your solution/project is found to be “substantially similar” to that of another student, or if it is determined that someone else wrote your project for you, then at a minimum you and the other student (if applicable) will receive a grade of zero for that assignment/project and in some series cases (such as in term projects) a 10 point deduction in your semester average. Furthermore, all parties concerned will have their prior projects re-checked for cheating. Any second incident will result in a grade of ‘F’ for the semester. Also, checking for cheating may occur at any time during the semester. Therefore, if you cheated on Project 1, you may be confronted about that at any time; receiving a grade for a project does not mean you are “in the clear”.

All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the University’s Academic Conduct Committee for further action, which may include, but is not limited to, academic suspension or dismissal from the university.

The UMBC academic integrity policy is available at https://academicconduct.umbc.edu/"
AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/academic-conduct/zero-tolerance-policy/,Zero-Tolerance Policy,"Dear DATA Program Students:

As a reminder, the DATA program, CSEE department, and UMBC maintain a zero-tolerance policy regarding academic integrity violations. Under UMBC policy (insert link), academic misconduct may take numerous forms such as (but not limited to) those listed below:

A. Fabrication: The intentional and unauthorized generation or augmentation of data, information, citation, or result in an academic exercise.
B. Falsification: The intentional and unauthorized altering of any information, citation, or result in an academic exercise.
C. Plagiarism: The intentional or knowing representation of the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in an academic exercise. The appropriation of the language, ideas, or thoughts of another and representation of them as one’s own original work.
D. Cheating: The intentional use or attempted use of unauthorized material in an academic exercise.
E. Improprieties of Authorship: Improper assignment of credit or misrepresentation of material as original without proper referencing of the original authors.
F. Facilitating Academic Dishonesty: The intentional or knowing assistance or attempted assistance of another student to commit an act of academic misconduct.

(This includes using software, sites, services, or technologies that assist with any of the above actions for your benefit or the benefit of others.)

Please know that academic integrity violations reported by CSEE/DATA faculty are investigated promptly and reported to the UMBC Graduate School for tracking and potential adjudication. Depending on the situation, the penalties for academic integrity violations can include receiving zero credit for an assignment, failing a course, being placed on academic probation, suspension, expulsion, or other sanctions.

Again, on behalf of UMBC and the faculty/staff in the DATA program, we wish you the very best for a successful semester!"

Who is the chair of the Data Science program?

At UMBC, the departments have chairs. Since we are a program (not a department), we don’t have a chair. Our Graduate Program Director is Dr. Ergun Simsek (simsek@umbc.edu).

I have a problem with/question on X. Whom should I contact (Y)?

If X == Academic Matters, then Y = OPP Student Success Team or Your Advisor (see above)
If X == Administrative Matters (course registration, applications, etc), then Y = Program Coordinator (see below)

COMMUNICATIONS

Communications with the core Faculty & Staff: Given the nature and size of our program, e-mail is the best way to reach our faculty and staff.

If you have administrative questions about the program (schedules, deadlines, fees, policies, paperwork, graduation, class locations, class registrations, credit transfer, etc.), please contact our program coordinators as follows.

Main campus students should email datascience-mps@umbc.edu
Shady Grove students should email sgprofessionalprograms@umbc.edu

Communicate with your Instructors: Professors are not mind-readers. If you have problems in your course or will be absent from a class, email your professor as soon as possible! In many cases, if they know about a situation and there’s a valid reason (such as a prolonged work deployment mid-semester) they can work with you to try and develop acceptable alternative arrangements. However, if they don’t know why you’re missing from class or haven’t turned in assignments, they will not chase after you — but grade you accordingly.

STUDENT E-MAIL LIST

The DATA Student email list serves as the official “broadcast” medium for announcements, new courses, events, relevant talks, job opportunities, etc — so be sure to monitor or appropriately manage your UMBC email address. If you need to update your address on that list, contact our program coordinators.

TRANSFER CREDIT

UMBC can accept up to 6 relevant graduate credits toward the DATA MPS provided they have not been used as part of other earned degrees and were a “B” grade or higher. You will need to submit the course description and syllabus along with the Graduate School form requesting the transfer credit. For more details

Main campus students should email datascience-mps@umbc.edu
Shady Grove students should email sgprofessionalprograms@umbc.edu

GRADES

The following symbols are used for grades: A, B, C, D, F, and I.
D and F are not passing grades.
“I” means incomplete!
Because graduate students must maintain an overall ‘B’ average, every credit hour of ‘C’ in coursework must be balanced by a credit hour of ‘A.’
A course in which a grade less than ‘B’ is received may be repeated. On the transcript, ‘R’ (Repeated) denotes a repeated course. Only the grade on the repeated courses, whether it is higher or lower than the original grade, is used in the computation of the cumulative GPA; however, all grades earned remain on the transcript.
You must have a B or higher in all certificate courses to earn the certificate and must maintain a B average to graduate with the MPS degree.

SEMESTERS/SCHEDULING

As with most universities, our ‘primary’ semesters are Fall and Spring. For the DATA program, we do not run courses over Winter Session since it is too short a timeframe for most students (and our adjunct faculty) to commit to attending class 3-4 times a week for a month. However, we do run courses over the summer — but which ones and which summer session(s) they are offered are dependent on instructor availability, so there may or may not be courses of interest, necessary for your degree progression, or that fit your schedule during summertime. It depends on what is offered and when. Of course, if courses are added to the schedule after registration opens — for any semester or session – we announce them by the DATA student email list.

TIME-TO-COMPLETE

Since international students are required to take 3 courses every Fall and Spring semester (unless it is their last semester at UMBC), they generally finish our program in 16 months (i.e. Start September 202X, Graduation: December 202X+1).

However, working professionals generally take 2 courses per semester due to their already busy schedules and they generally complete their degrees in approximately 2 years.

Most Certificate students complete their certificates in two semesters.

ADA REQUIREMENTS

Any ADA or documented special needs must be brought to your professor’s attention during the first week of the semester, and proper university/medical documentation must be provided. Retroactive accommodations may not be accepted.

RESEARCH & WRITING

As both graduate students and professionals, you will be expected to produce written deliverables that are appropriate for your classroom experience and profession or industry. Therefore, if you think you need assistance with developing and/or “brushing up” on graduate-level research and/or writing skills, UMBC offers a range of resources to help you obtain or polish those critical skills to enable you to succeed fully. If needed, I encourage you to take advantage of these campus resources — they’re here for your benefit:

Graduate Student Association Writing Advisor"
AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/policies/,Policies,"The categories listed below are a collection of procedures, guidelines, expectations, and policies to help you successfully navigate through your MPS study here at UMBC. Certificate rules are slightly different. Please see the university catalog for PCB-related policies. While most policies officially reside on our online catalog, others may refer you to other organizations on campus.

Academic Integrity

These policies pertain to a student’s rights and responsibilities here at UMBC, including: academic integrity, responsible research conduct, academic misconduct, handling grading allegations, student mediation, and academic dismissal appeals.

Enrollment & Registration

Students looking to make changes to their academic or administrative record while at UMBC should be aware of certain enrollment policies, such as: disclosure of student records, continuous enrollment expectations, reinstatement processes, withdrawal procedure, Full and Part-time status, leave of absence, and transfer of credits.

Academic Progress

Grading policies, academic probation, and satisfactory progress are all discussed as policies pertaining to academic progress towards degree completion.

University Policies

These policies are for all UMBC students and are administered by UMBC organizations outside the Graduate School. These policies include: the Code of Student Conduct, In-State Residency status, and Student Health Insurance."
AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/policies/academic-integrity/,Academic Integrity,"The UMBC community – faculty, administration, and students – are committed to creating an academic environment in which teaching, learning, and research are conducted according to the principles of academic integrity. Our website summarizes the many initiatives undertaken to assure this commitment. Both UMBC’s President and Provost are resolved to have academic integrity be integral to our campus culture.

UMBC’s general academic policies may be found on the Provost’s website. Please review the list of policies so that you will be aware of their existence and web location.

Graduate School Academic Integrity Tutorial

Students arriving at UMBC to begin graduate study come from very different places and backgrounds. Some have had little undergraduate instruction on topics such as plagiarism and the proper citation of sources. Others have come from countries where norms of academic integrity are very different from those in the United States. Because of this, we have developed a tutorial that is required of all entering graduate students.

Academic Integrity is a very complex set of ethical policies and principles, and this tutorial provides only a basic, elementary overview. It is, in effect, “Academic Integrity 101.” Each academic discipline has its own variations to the policies, definitions, and examples presented here. Students are encouraged to delve more deeply into the topics outlined in this tutorial by reading some of the references presented in the final chapter, Bibliography and Additional Reading. You are also encouraged to consult with faculty in your department for exceptions, modifications, and additional requirements demanded by your particular discipline.

If you need to report an instance of academic misconduct, speak to the appropriate faculty member. The university policy states that, “Each faculty member is responsible for maintaining academic integrity in his or her courses and has the authority to determine whether a student has engaged in academic misconduct.” 1

Throughout your studies at UMBC, the faculty and staff are available to assist in assuring that you adhere to the concepts of academic integrity. Please contact the faculty and staff in your department and/or the Graduate School if you have questions or are unsure of how to adhere to these policies.

This web document will be continually updated and modified to better represent the wide range of topics and disciplines covered.

Taking the Tutorial

Each new degree-seeking graduate student entering UMBC is required to pass the test by September 15 (Fall) or February 15 (Spring). Failure to complete the tutorial and pass the test with a score of 80% or above will result in your registration being blocked for future terms.

You must be enrolled in the tutorial to gain access.

When you are ready to begin the tutorial:

Login to Blackboard at blackboard.umbc.edu.
After you login, click on Organizations. This should list the organizations and courses in which you participate.
Click on the Graduate School Academic Integrity Tutorial tab and this screen should appear; Welcome to the Graduate School’s tutorial on Academic Integrity! The column on the left has the tabs for each module.
You should read the definitions, examples, and explanations within the various tutorial “chapters.”
When you are ready to be tested on your knowledge of this material, click the “click to launch” at the end of each module, and take the test. You may save and leave the tutorial as often as you wish, so that it need not be completed in one sitting. You will be able to see as you proceed through the material what your cumulative score is. Each of 20 questions has a score of 5, and a passing score is a total of 80 or higher; therefore, only a maximum of 4 of the 20 questions may be answered incorrectly.
When you have completed the tutorial, make sure to click on the submit tab, so that your scores will be tabulated.
You must have a score of 80% or above to successfully complete the tutorial.

If you are a continuing student or UMBC faculty, and do not have access to the tutorial on Blackboard, but wish to be enrolled, please send an e-mail request to Lisa Portis Morgan. Include your name and UMBC email address.

AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/policies/enrollment-and-registration-policies/,Enrollment and Registration Policies,"Continuous Enrollment

Once admitted to a graduate program, each student has the obligation to continue a course of study and must register every semester in the academic year (both fall and spring semesters). Failure to comply with the requirement to register every semester will be taken as evidence that the student has terminated his or her program and admission status in the Graduate School. A new application for admission with the consequent re-evaluation of the student’s performance may be required of a student wishing to resume a graduate program terminated under this regulation.

Leave of Absence

Students who wish to continue in a degree program, but who cannot study in a particular semester or year, should notify their Graduate Program Directors and the Assistant Dean for Graduate Progressions and Academic Services in the Graduate School using the Leave of Absence Request Form .

A leave of absence is NOT required for summer or winter terms.

The five-year period for completion of the master’s degree or for admission to doctoral candidacy begins with the first semester of enrollment; this “clock” does not stop during leaves of absence. If additional time is needed to complete your degree or to reach candidacy, you can submit a request for an extension to the Associate Dean’s office.

Failure to enroll after two consecutive semesters of leave of absence will result in your enrollment status changing from active to discontinued, unless approval has been granted in advance by the Associate Dean of the Graduate School for additional semesters of leave of absence.

A student who is not enrolled, is not eligible to utilize university resources.

Reinstatement

Students who wish to return to their programs after being discontinued for exceeding the leave of absence period must complete the Returning Student Request Form, obtain the Graduate Program Director’s signature, and submit the signed form to the Graduate School at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the desired term of re-enrollment.

A student who has been absent from UMBC for a longer period of time and wishes to continue graduate studies may be required to reapply. The student should contact the appropriate program to which he or she was admitted for advice, and the graduate program director will notify the Graduate School about the recommended procedure.

Program Change

If a student wishes to change graduate programs after having been admitted and enrolled, the required steps depend upon whether the two programs are in the same department.

If they are in the same department (e.g., Data Science and Cybersecurity), the student should consult with the graduate program directors (GPDs) in both programs for permission. The GPD in the program to which the student wishes to move will notify the Graduate School that all parties agree with the change. The student will need to initiate the process using the Program Change form found on the Graduate School website.

If the two programs are in different departments (e.g., Computer Science and Information Systems), the student must apply to the new program (submitting a new application and fee) and be formally admitted.

Withdrawal

If, after registration, a student wishes to discontinue pursuing a degree, a written notice of request for withdrawal from the university must be filed with the Graduate School. Withdrawal forms are available on the Graduate School Web site.

Course Load

The Graduate School at UMBC considers graduate students enrolled for a combination of courses carrying nine credits or more in a fall or spring semester to be full-time students. Full-time status may be defined differently by outside agencies and by some financial aid programs.

Graduate Assistants must be registered full-time in each Fall or Spring semester whether they are appointed to a full-time assistantship or a half-time assistantship.

Policy on Double Counting Courses

For students pursuing more than one Masters degree (either concurrently, or sequentially), coursework may not be utilized twice (i.e. “double counted”) in fulfillment of each degree. The exception is coursework taken through the accelerated Bachelor’s/Master’s program at UMBC, which permits transfer of up to six credits.

Auditing a Course

A graduate student who wishes to show that he or she has attended a course but does not seek academic credit, may register in a course as an auditor. The notation “AU” is listed for audited courses for which no credits are attempted or earned.

Audited courses count as zero-credit toward ALL enrollment certifications, such as full-time enrollment. Audited courses are not eligible for financial aid, nor are they considered when determining financial aid eligibility.

Tuition and fees for audit courses are the same as those charged for credit courses.

When the audit option is selected, the faculty teaching the audited class may set certain criteria which the auditor must meet, such as class attendance.

Inter-Institutional Enrollment

It is the university’s policy to encourage graduate students enrolled on one campus of the university to avail themselves of course offerings, research facilities and special faculty competencies on the other campuses of the University System of Maryland. The home campus retains responsibility for admission, academic advising, the collection of tuition and fees, grants of financial aid, the academic transcript and the awarding of the graduate degree. The host campus provides, on a space-available basis, access to courses and seminars, research facilities and libraries.

Enrollment Process for Outbound Students (UMBC Home)

The student completes the inter-institutional enrollment form*, which can be found at the Registrar’s Website.
The student is responsible for acquiring the UMBC Graduate Program Director’s signature on the inter-institutional form.
The student submits the form directly to the Registrar’s Office for enrollment.
The Registrar’s Office sends the completed enrollment form to the host campus to register the student for the specific course.

Enrollment Process for Inbound Students (UMBC Host)

The student completes the inter-institutional enrollment form*, which can be found at the Registrar’s Website.
The student is responsible for acquiring the UMBC Graduate Program Director’s signature on the inter-institutional form.
The student then submits the signed form to the Graduate School at UMBC for application processing.
The Graduate School submits the completed inter-institutional enrollment form to the Registrar’s Office.
The Registrar’s Office then registers the student for the specified course.

*Please indicate on the form if your home/host campus is at Shady Grove.

Tuition and Fees and Financial Aid

The graduate student taking courses at a host campus pays the tuition and fees required of graduate students on the home campus

Parking

It is the responsibility of the student to determine the parking policies of the host campus, and the student must abide by parking policies of that campus. Some campuses honor parking permits from other USM campuses. Some require visiting students to purchase a parking permit for the host campus.

Library Privileges

The graduate student at a host campus enjoys similar library privileges extended to all graduate students on that campus. A temporary one-semester library card will be issued upon presentation of the home campus library card.

Emergency Medical Service

The graduate student at a host campus is granted emergency medical care comparable to that available to graduate students on the home campus. Evidence of payment of the health fee on the home campus or a copy of the approved request for permission to enroll will admit the graduate student to emergency medical service."
AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/policies/academic-progress/,Academic Progress,"Grades and Grading Policies for MPS Students

The following symbols are used for grades:

“A”,”B”,”C” (Passing), “D,”F” (Failure) and ‘I’ (Incomplete). Because graduate students must maintain an overall ‘B’ average, every credit hour of ‘C’ in course work must be balanced by a credit hour of ‘A.’

A course in which a grade less than ‘B’ is received may be repeated. On the transcript, ‘R’ (Repeated) denotes a repeated course. Only the grade on the repeated courses, whether it is higher or lower than the original grade, is used in the computation of the cumulative GPA; however, all grades earned remain on the transcript. On the transcript, ‘NA’ (Non-Applicable) denotes a course that does not apply to the degree program and does not enter into GPA calculation. Courses in the student’s designated degree program that are completed with a ‘D’ or an ‘F’ must be repeated. No student may graduate with an unresolved ‘F’ on the record.

A ‘Pass-Fail’ (P-F) grading system may be used at the discretion of the department or program for certain types of graduate study and with the approval of the Graduate Council. These include courses that require independent field work, special projects or independent study. The P-F grade option for conventional courses that are being used toward a degree is not available to students at the graduate level.

Note that the certificate students need to get a B or better grade in all the courses they take.

Plus/Minus Grading

Faculty have the option of assigning grades that include a plus or a minus (e.g., “B+”) to graduate students enrolled in graduate courses. This option is not available for undergraduate students enrolled in graduate courses or graduate students enrolled in undergraduate courses. As plus/minus grading is only an option, faculty may, at their discretion, continue to assign only single letter grades (e.g., “B”). By design, the grade of “A” still indicates superior achievement, so “A+” is not assignable. Furthermore, the grades of “D” and “F” still indicate unacceptable performance, so plus/minus grading is not assignable for either. Graduate students are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 during their entire course of study. The transition to optional plus/minus grading does not change this standard. The following table delineates the grade options and their respective quality points.

Graduate – Grades and Notations

A Superior (4.0 Quality Points)
A- (3.7 Quality Points)
B+ (3.3 Quality Points)
B Good (3.0 Quality Points)
B- (2.7 Quality Points)
C+ (2.3 Quality Points)
C Not Satisfactory (2.0 Quality Points)
C- (1.7 Quality Points)
D Unacceptable (1.0 Quality Points)
F Failure (0 Quality Points)
AU Audit (No Credits Attempted or Earned)
Temporary and Final Grades

Students are expected to complete all the requirements of graduate course work in the semester in which the course is taken, and the graduate faculty is expected to issue final grades (‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘C,’ ‘D’ or ‘F’) by the date listed on the Final Report of Grades. Students failing to meet this requirement may, upon request, be awarded a temporary grade of ‘Incomplete.’ Faculty needing additional time for the grading process may award a temporary grade of ‘No Mark’ or ‘NM.’

Incomplete Grades

An incomplete (‘I’) grade must be changed to a final letter grade (‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘C,’ ‘D’ or ‘F’) for all courses required for the degree. For courses not required for the degree, an ‘I’ mark may remain on the student’s transcript. This policy does not apply to the 799, 898 and 899 research grades, where letter grades, P-F grades or ‘I’ grades may be assigned. In those cases where grades of ‘I’ have been assigned, they should be replaced and assigned an appropriate terminal grade when the applicable research has been approved by the examining committee.

Appeal of Grade

A student who believes that a final grade in a course is improper and the result of arbitrary and capricious grading may appeal to the dean of the Graduate School. A copy of the ‘Procedural Guidelines for Handling of Allegations of Arbitrary and Capricious Grading ‘ may be viewed here and is on file in all graduate program offices and in the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School.

Transcripts

A graduate student’s academic record (transcript) is intended to serve as a complete history of the student’s academic progress at UMBC. As such, it cannot be altered except in conformance with stated Graduate School policies governing change of election. Under no circumstances will the academic records be altered because of dissatisfaction with a grade or other academic accomplishment. The university’s Disclosure of Student Records Policy describes UMBC’s compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Academic Standards and Probation

All graduate students are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 during their entire course of study. Failure to do so may result in academic dismissal.

Students who do not maintain a ‘B’ (3.0) average may be placed on academic probation. To avoid dismissal from the Graduate School, the student must achieve a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 by the end of the semester following being placed on probation. In some cases, a student may receive a warning before being placed on probation. Some departments have a policy of recommending that the Graduate School dismiss any student who has received a grade of ‘D’ or ‘F.’"

Who should apply for the Master of Professional Studies: Data Science program?

Anyone interested in advancing their career or changing career paths by developing data science skills is encouraged to apply.

Is MPS (Master of Professional Studies) the same as MS (Master of Science)?

No. Please visit this page where we discuss the differences between MPS and MS.

What kinds of jobs can someone with a master’s degree in data science do?

Please read this collaged article: https://dil.umbc.edu/jobs-you-can-do-with-a-master/

What are the eligibility requirements for the Master of Professional Studies: Data Science program?

Successful applicants should have:

An undergraduate degree
GPA of 3.0 (out of 4.0) or higher
Competency in Calculus, Statistics, and basic programming.
English proficiency score

How is applicants’ competency in calculus, statistics, or basic programming assessed?

We examine students’ transcripts and expect a grade of B or higher in courses related to these three subjects.

What can applicants do if they do not meet some of the requirements?

International candidates, who are already in the US but no previous courses in calculus, statistics, or basic programming, should take these courses at a university or a community college before they submit their application.

International candidates, who are not in the US, should take these courses at internationally accredited higher-education institutions before they submit their application.

What can applicants do if they meet the requirements but need a refresher?

We also have three foundational data science courses to teach these subjects. These courses are:

Statistical Analysis and Visualization with Python
Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning

If an applicant has taken courses in the past but wants to refresh their fundamentals on one of these subjects, then they can take the corresponding course in their first semester at UMBC.

Does UMBC offer undergraduate-level courses that will satisfy the prerequisites for the program? If so, what are these courses?

If the candidate is interested in taking these courses at UMBC, we recommend they take Math 151, Stat 355, and CMSC 201 (Python section) to meet the pre-requirements.

Where can I take the prerequisite undergraduate-level courses if I can’t take them at UMBC?

Due to their lower fees, community colleges might be a good alternative. Near our main campus, the Community College of Baltimore County offers Math 251 and Math 153, which help students meet our calculus and stats prerequisites. Similarly, Montgomery College offers MATH 181 and MATH 117 near our Shady Grove campus. Students, who are interested in taking online courses, might consider the University of Maryland University College’s MATH 140 and STAT 200 courses.

Do you admit students for summer sessions?

No. We only admit students for the Fall and Spring semesters.

Is GRE required?

No.

Is there a thesis requirement?

No, there is no formal thesis defense. However, the MPS DS includes a semester-long capstone project which involves significant research and writing.

Is work experience required?

No.

If I am denied admission, can I apply again?

Yes, you may apply again by submitting a new application and supplemental material for the following semester(s). NOTE: Denied applicants cannot re-apply for the same semester.

If I am admitted, can I defer admission?

Students can defer their admission up to two semesters. The deferral form can be found at https://gradschool.umbc.edu/students/forms/

Do you accept online tests provided by Duolingo?

Yes, we accept Duolingo test results. The minimum score needed is 120.

I took an ELC exam many years ago, would you accept it?

Scores must be less than two years old.

How long does the program take to complete?

International students need to take at least 9 credits every semester (except the last one) due to their F1 status. Hence our international student generally earn their degrees in 3 or 4 semesters.

Can I get my certificate in addition to my Master’s?

Yes, you can. Please visit this page to learn the details. Note that per Graduate School policy, you must have a B or higher in all certificate courses to earn the certificate and must maintain a B average to graduate with the MPS degree.

Will students’ schedules be flexible?

All the Data Science classes are held in the evenings or taught online so that working professionals have great flexibility in terms of choosing their courses. If a student is available only for evening classes, then s/he can complete the program with courses offered by MPS (i.e. Data Science, Cybersecurity, Project Management, Management Science, Bioinformatics, and Health IT). Other pathway courses (offered by Computer Science, Information Systems, and Public Policy) might take place during the daytime; so students need to adjust their schedules.

What degree will be written on the diploma?

The diploma will specifically have a “Master of Professional Studies” degree.

May students participate in the on-campus graduation ceremony?

Yes, they may.

Are there some online classes?

Yes, we offer at least one online section of all the core data science courses (e.g. Data 601-606). International students need to take at least one in-person class due to visa regulations.

What is the expected class size?

25 students or less.

What does the class schedule look like?

Classes run during the evenings Monday through Thursday.

Are summer courses offered?

Yes, we generally offer a few courses (either 6, 8, or 12 weeks) over the summer session. Consult the Schedule of Classes for information on times and locations. Summer courses may meet more frequently due to the shortened summer schedule.

Do I have to take 3 courses in the summer?

No.

Can I take courses both at UMBC’s Main Campus and the Universities at Shady Grove?

Yes.

Is there a difference between the coursework and the faculty that is provided at the main and Shady Grove campuses?

The same set of courses is taught by different faculty members. However, sometimes a faculty, who teaches a course on the main campus, teaches the same course at the Shady Grove campus (or vice versa) next semester.

Is the MPS DS program considered a STEM program?

Yes, our MPS DS program is eligible for the STEM OPT extension.

Universities are required by various agencies and accreditors to assign a CIP code to each program of study they offer. The CIP code for MPS Data Science is 11.0802 which is included on the DHS list of STEM extension eligible programs.

Can international students gain real-world experience, i.e. internship?

Yes, see the question/answer below.

Are international students of the MPS DS program eligible for CPT and OPT?

International graduates typically apply for OPT (Optional Practical Training) after they graduate. International students can apply for CPT (Curricular Practical Training) as well after completing two full semesters. If you are interested in this option, please contact the Program Director as soon as possible. Please direct all further questions regarding CPT, OPT, or STEM to the Office of International Education Services.

Students need to complete two full semesters before they can start working. So this means that if you a student starts in the Fall semester, then that student can work in the summer of the following year. However, if a student starts in the Spring semester, then that student cannot work in the summer of that year.

Where can I find the MPS in Data Science curriculum?

Visit our “Course Descriptions” page.

What are the programming languages used in the program?

The main programming language of the program is Python.

Can I transfer graduate credits from another institution into the UMBC Data Science Program?

You may be able to transfer up to six graduate credit hours earned from another institution into a UMBC Data Science program. Contact the Graduate Program Director to discuss your situation and be sure to include a complete course description. A 3.0 GPA is required for each course transferred. Once you are admitted and an enrolled student in UMBC’s program, you must complete and submit a Transfer of Credit Request Form.

What is the total cost of the program? 

Our program requires 30-credits to obtain an MPS degree. The tuition and fees differ based on students’ residency and where they take courses (i.e. at Main Campus or at Shady Grove campus). Please visit Student Business Services’ website for up-to-date information.

Is financial aid available?

No

Does the program offer any scholarships?

No.

Does the program offer teaching assistantships or research assistantships?

No. As the Data Science program, unfortunately, we don’t have any sort of financial aid (neither a scholarship nor an assistantship). A few of our students currently work as research assistants for CS and IS professors but their number is low compared to the total number of international students.

We hire a few of our senior students (who completed Data 601-604) as tutors/graders but the amount we pay is low compared to assistantships.

Some of our students were able to find internships and full-time jobs through UMBC Career Center’s website. Some other students found jobs on campus through UMBCWORKS. However, you’ll need a UMBC account to log in.

When is my tuition payment due?

Your bill for your tuition and fees each semester is only generated when you register for classes. You can use the billing calendar to see the schedule of when your bill will be generated, and when it is due, based on when you register each semester.

Please note that bills are only generated in your MyUMBC account – you will not receive a paper bill in the mail. You can see your bill by logging into your MyUMBC account, and under the Topics menu, choose Billing and Personal Finances. You can click on Payments and Billing to see your bill, or click on Account Inquiry to see a live balance, which will reflect recent transactions before your actual bill is updated.

Bills can be paid in a number of ways, including those listed here on SBS’s website.

If your family or another individual should have access to your bill, you can set up a “parent PIN” that allows another person to have access to your bill. PIN stands for Personal Identification Number. Log in to your MyUMBC account, click on Topics, then Billing and Personal Finances, then Payments and Billing, then click on “create new” under the Parent PIN section.

If your bill is paid by an outside organization, such as a scholarship from your home government, you can learn more about connecting your financial sponsor to UMBC here.

I’m planning to pay my tuition costs using a bank loan, but my bank will only grant me a loan after I receive admission. What can I do?

There is no problem from our end. If you meet the admission criteria, then we’ll admit you and you will have time to take care of such issues.

If I decide to drop off a course or leave the program, can I get my money back?

The answer depends on the timing of your decision. If you apply for a refund in the first week of that semester, you will get a full refund. Later in the semester, the less refund you will get. Please visit Student Business Services’ website for details.

Can I change my program from Data Science to another one?

You can after completing one semester. The Graduate School does not consider a program plan change request until the student has at least one semester of courses completed.  Any program plan change request needs to be approved by multiple academic departments, including the student’s current program, as well as the program to which the student is requesting the change. Grades, course relevance, and other factors will be considered before any change is approved. Newly admitted graduate students are not eligible for a program plan change."

AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/prospective-students/umbc-undergraduate-students/,UMBC Undergraduate Students,"I am an undergraduate student at UMBC. Can I take one Data Science courses as an elective? What’s the enrollment procedure?

Short Answer: If you (1) are within seven credits of graduation; (2) have a GPA of 3.0 or higher; (3)already have taken courses on calculus, statistics, and programming, and (4) if you meet the prerequisites of that course, then yes you might take that course.

Long Answer: University System of Maryland undergraduate students who have a grade point average of at least 3.0 in the discipline in which the graduate course is to be taken and who are within seven credits of graduation may register in the undergraduate college for certain 600-level and higher courses, which may later be counted for credit toward a graduate degree at UMBC if the student is in an approved accelerated program. Except in approved accelerated programs, the credits must be in addition to those required for the student’s undergraduate degree. Credits in the senior year exceeding those required for graduation cannot be used for graduate credit without prior written approval of the appropriate faculty and the Graduate School.

Procedure: Please fill out the “Data Science Course Enrollment Request Form (For Non-Majors)”. A link to this form is given in the course description. Filling out this form does not guarantee a spot for you in that class. We give permissions to non-data science students two weeks before the semester starts on a first come first serve basis. If the class is full, we can’t accommodate such requests.

Accelerated Data Science Program: BS or BA/MPS in Data Science
UMBC undergraduate students have the option of applying to the accelerated Data Science Bachelor’s/MPS program in the Spring Semester of their junior year and may take up to nine graduate credits that can be applied to both their undergraduate and graduate degrees. Students benefit by shortening the time to degree completion, experience the cost savings of taking graduate courses at undergraduate tuition rates, experience flexible learning options (some courses taught in evening or in hybrid format) and gain practical knowledge and skills.
Admissions Requirements for CMSC students
Minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.0
Maintain good academic standing throughout the duration of undergraduate degree
Students are required to complete CMSC 331, CMSC 341, and STAT 355.*

*Note that the three courses mentioned above have certain prerequisites. Students are suggested to take MATH 151, MATH 152, MATH 221, CMSC 201, CMSC 202, and CMSC 203 in their first and second years if they are interested in this accelerated Bachelor/MPS degree focusing on Data Science.

Application Process

Please discuss with your academic advisor before you submit an application

PART 1

Complete the Graduate School Accelerated Bachelor’s/Master’s Application Form
Attach a copy of your UMBC transcript to this application (the one printed from myUMBC is acceptable)
Submit required documentation to your Undergraduate Advisor for preliminary review and approval. If approved your application will be reviewed by the Data Science Graduate Program Director and a final admission decision will be made.
Once approved, complete the Approval for Undergraduates to take Courses for Graduate Credit.

PART 2

One semester prior to completion of your bachelor’s degree, submit an application for the MPS: Data Science program to the Graduate School. The graduate school application fee is waived for UMBC students.
Once admitted to the MPS Data Science program, complete transfer of credits form to Graduate School for nine credits
How it Works
Students are required to take 10 courses (30 credits) in order to get their MPS degree. Nine of these 30 credits will be double-counted towards their undergraduate degree.
Students are advised to spread these 10 courses into four more semesters. For example
Fall of 4th year: DATA 601 and BS/BA courses
Spring of 4th year: DATA 602, DATA 607, and BS/BA courses
Fall of 5th year: DATA 603, DATA 604, DATA 605, Elective Course-1
Spring of 5th year: DATA 606, Elective Course-2, Elective Course-3
Accelerated Bachelor/MPS Program Regulations and Procedures

Once admitted to the combined program, the student must maintain a 3.0 or higher grade point average. No more than two “C” grades may be received in all courses taken after admission. If the GPA falls below 3.0 or if more than two “C” grades are received, the student will be removed from the combined program. This does not affect the student’s eligibility for the bachelor degree under normal University undergraduate requirements. Any one “D” or “F” also results in removal from the combined program.

Students in the combined program must formally apply for admission to the Graduate School before the application deadline during the semester in which the course work for the bachelor degree is completed. No more than 9 credits of graduate courses may be taken while the student is paying undergraduate tuition."
AI,https://dil.umbc.edu/prospective-students/partnership-with-nih-faes/,Partnership with NIH FAES,"UMBC and the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences (FAES) at NIH established a partnership to extend academic opportunities for their respective students. Qualified students who successfully complete coursework in data science, bioinformatics, or technology transfer at FAES may be able to transfer coursework into UMBC’s Master of Professional Studies in Data Science.
