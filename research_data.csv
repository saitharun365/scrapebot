Brain Discovery

The human brain is the most complex organ in our body – and possibly the most complex entity on earth.  It controls decision making to each and every process that controls our body.  This organ that weighs just about three pounds has stunned and delighted scientists and engineers for decades and continues to do so.  Our work encompasses brain-computer interfaces, their applications in human-robot interaction, the study of brain networks and connectivity, understanding the brain function using brain imaging and data fusion methods, brain stimulation (deep and focused transcranial magnetic stimulation), and cortical arousal during sleep.  Our work targets understanding the healthy or developing brain as well as one suffering from a disorder.

Work in the area is conducted in the following research labs as well as part of an upcoming NSF IUCRC center, Building Reliable Advances in Neurotechnologies (BRAIN).  The center has the following five themes spearheaded by diverse faculty in our department: cyber-human systems, AI and Big Data for Brain, Neural Signal Processing and Machine learning, Neural stimulation, and Virtual and augmented reality.  For more information please see www.nsfbrain.org.

Human-System Engineering to Optimize Health and Performance
The proliferation of technologies for mobile and pervasive sensing, advances in computational/cloud capabilities, and advances in machine learning and AI are shaping multidisciplinary frontiers for systems that improve the human condition: health and well-being.  Individuals and patients across diverse groups and caregivers cooperating with new technology can now address afflictions and surpass past limitations, such as those imposed by gaps in observability and obstacles to the frequency of interactions so that we can
explore new datasets with increased volume, complexity, and real-world variability;
develop novel systems to collect data and provide real-time feedback and intervention;
enable caregiver data exploration and assisted interpretation.
Humans and systems can work integratively to address a wide range of health and performance-related conditions, including disease states (e.g., diagnosis, illness trajectory monitoring) and performance states (e.g., stress, fatigue, boredom). Our research in this area spans sensor and embedded system development, real-time control systems, and applications of machine learning methods to human state estimation.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. It focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language—or the computational processing of human-human communication, aiming to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a manner that is both meaningful and useful. Although definitions might vary, the broadest definition of NLP encompasses textual processing & understanding as well as speech processing (speech recognition/analysis/synthesis), natural language generation (NLG), computational linguistics (using computational techniques to study human languages), and social computing (social media analysis). Many modern NLP techniques leverage machine learning and deep learning, seeking to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding. As an evolving field, NLP continues to grow in importance with the increasing volume of unstructured data and the rising use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. NLP can include a variety of tasks such as text analysis, translation, and summarization. (Description edited from GPT-4o output using the prompt “Please provide a paragraph describing the field of natural language processing.”)

NLP Research at UMBC has included, but is not limited to:

Grounded understanding of events
Safe usage of LLMs via neuro-symbolic methods
NLP and robotics
Applications for text generation
Reasoning with extracted representations from text
Social computing
Multimodal Learning (vision and language)

Center for Accelerated Real Time Analytics (CARTA)

CARTA is an NSF sponsored IUCRC center focused on cutting edge inter-disciplinary research in real time analytics using next generation accelerated hardware.

Real time analytics is the leading edge of a smart data revolution, pushed by Internet advances in sensor hardware on one side and AI/ML streaming acceleration on the other. CARTA explores the realm streaming applications of Magna Analytics. The center works with next-generation hardware technologies, like the IBM Minsky with onboard GPU accelerated processors and Flash RAM, and smart cyber-physical sensor systems to build cognitive analytics systems and active storage devices for real time analytics. This will lead to the automated ingestion and simultaneous analytics of Big Datasets generated in various domains including cybersecurity, gealthcare, Internet of Things (IoT) and the scientific arena, and the creation of self learning, self correcting “smart” systems.

Center for Real-time Distributed Sensing and Autonomy (CARDS)

The vision of CARDS is to advance AI-based autonomy in order to deliver safe, effective, and resilient new capabilities across a variety of complex mission types, including search-and-rescue, persistent surveillance, managing, adapting and optimizing smart, connected robots and machinery, and augmenting humans in performing complex analytical and decision-making tasks. These systems are continually getting better, but to achieve their potential, there are still numerous developments required to improve their capability, command and control, interoperability, resiliency and trustworthiness. Inaugural Funding for CARDS is from the  Army Research Lab for the period 2021-2026.
