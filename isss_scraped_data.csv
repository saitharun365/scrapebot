Current Students: General,https://isss.umbc.edu/international-students-f-1/current-students/,Current Students: General - Main Content,"In this section you will find more information on opportunities, rules and requirements for current F-1 International students.  One of the most important services we can offer is to make sure students understand the rules they need to follow, to be able to remain in the US.  Thus, please find a brief summary here of the most important requirements for maintaining your status, and read through this section of our website for more information on these and more important pieces of information to help you understand your immigration status.

 

Full time academic registration

F-1 students must enroll full-time every semester.  There are other circumstances where a student can register less than full time – for example, for unexpected medical reasons. Students must seek permission from one of the international student advisors prior to dropping below the required full time status, which must be reported to USCIS.

Employment/work

International students are permitted to work on campus ONLY. Students cannot, under any circumstances, work off campus unless authorized by an international student advisor.   Off-campus employment opportunities and work limitations are detailed in our website. ISSS offers regular workshops on CPT and OPT to help you learn more about how to take advantage of these opportunities as well.

I-20 expiration

If the program end date on your I-20 is nearing and you need more time to finish your program, you should speak to an international student advisor prior to your I-20 expiring. If you realize that you need more time to finish your studies but find that your I-20 has already expired, you are out of status and will need to apply for reinstatement. Always be aware of your program end date on your I-20.

Passport

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future to obtain an F-1 visa. Once in the United States, if you passport is about to expire please make the necessary plans to get it extended or apply for a new one. Plan to do this at least 3-4 months prior to the passport expiring.

Transferring from one school to another

If you decide that you are going to transfer from UMBC to another school of vice versa, please speak to the international student advisor about the transfer process. If it is not done correctly you could fall out of status.

Maintain status of F-2 Dependents

Students who have their spouse or children at UMBC on F-2 visas, based on their F-1 visa, must also make sure their dependents are in status.  F-2 visa holders must have a valid dependent I-20 at all times.

Additionally, F-2 visa holders may NOT work, and have restrictions on the types of educational programs they can begin, except for “vocational or recreational” courses, such as those taken as a hobby, like art or photography.

Crime

Committing a crime is a violation of your status and you will be arrested. You can be deported or denied a visa in the future. Be sure to review the information in your UMBC student handbook to be fully aware of UMBC rules and expectations.  Be sure to ask for clarification if you are unsure of any policy or regulation.

Please review this section of our website carefully for more detailed information about these requirements and opportunities, and the consequences of breaking immigration regulations."
Current Students: Employment,https://isss.umbc.edu/f-1-students/current-students-employment/,Current Students: Employment - Main Content,"International students have very specific kinds of work opportunities in the US.  We appreciate that students want to take advantage of work opportunities as much as possible to gain experience in their field, and we encourage you to do so, within the regulations concerning F-1 international student work.  To learn more about your options, please review this section of our website, including:

On campus work
Off – campus work through CPT (Curricular Practical Training)
Economic Hardship emergency work authorization

Working On-Campus,https://isss.umbc.edu/international-students-f-1/current-students-employment/working-on-campus/,Working On-Campus - Main Content,"F-1 International students are able to work up to 20 hours per week on campus during the fall and spring semesters, and up to 40 hours per week on campus during the summer and winter vacations.  No special authorization or application is required from ISSS – you are simply allowed to do this as a benefit of your immigration status.

“On campus” jobs can be defined as any job that is physically on campus and paid by UMBC.  Common examples are work done in any campus office, the Library or RAC (gym), food services, the Book Store, or Graduate Assistantship positions including TA’s, RA’s and GA’s.  A few exceptions exist – please contact the ISSS office if you are not sure if a job you are considering would classify as “on campus.”

When you receive your first job offer, you will need to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) if you don’t already have one. An SSN is required to be paid in the US.  To learn more about what an SSN is and how to apply, please review the information here.

The Career Center gives advice on how to look for an on-campus job here, but please note these are competitive and many students don’t find an on-campus job until their second semester, if they are looking.  Happy job hunting!"
Economoic Hardship Work Authorization,https://isss.umbc.edu/international-students-f-1/current-students-employment/economic-hardship-work-authorization/,Economoic Hardship Work Authorization - Main Content,"If you are an F-1 student experiencing severe and unexpected financial hardship while studying in the US, you may be able to obtain off-campus employment authorization from USCIS.  This authorization allows you to work to meet some of your living expenses. Keep in mind that economic hardship employment will probably not sustain all your financial needs during your difficult time and you should not rely on this to solve your situation for the reminder of your stay at UMBC as a student.  Please note, Economic Hardship work authorization is extremely difficult to get approved, and the application should only be compiled for those in truly dire need.

 

Eligibility

To qualify for economic hardship employment, you meet the following conditions:

You must have been in F-1 status for at least one full academic year (two semesters)
You must be able to document the circumstances which led to your economic situation were unforeseen, unexpected and beyond your control.
You must maintain your status by being enrolled in school full time during the spring and fall semesters when school is in session.

Conditions & Restrictions

Economic hardship employment authorization cards are issued in increments of one year at a time until your date of graduation (end date on I-20).
If you transfer from one school to another, the work authorization expires immediately.
Employment is limited to 20 hours a week when school is in session (spring and fall) and full time (more than 20 hours) during official school breaks (spring break, summer session, winter break and session).
You are still required to maintain full-time enrollment during the semesters
You can seek any job and the employment does not have to be related to your course of study.
Economic hardship does not affect your ability to be eligible for optional practical training (OPT).

Examples of unforeseen circumstances beyond your control include:

Death or severe illness of the financial sponsor
Loss of scholarship by no fault of the student
Substantial inflation of home currency rate
Natural disaster in home country that shows family has been directly affected
Unexpected and severe increase in tuition, fees or living expenses
Unforeseen and unexpected medical expenses of a family member, such as emergency surgery

Application Process

Meet with an international student advisor to discuss whether you are eligible to apply for this benefit. Please bring any and all documentation showing proof that your financial situation necessitates applying for the economic hardship. If we determine you to be eligible to apply for economic hardship, the advisor will request a new I-20 with a recommendation for economic hardship.

Please note, the application can take up to 3 months to process.

Understanding Your Documents,https://isss.umbc.edu/f-1-students/understanding-your-documents/,Understanding Your Documents - Main Content,"While you are a student in the US there are a few key documents that you should understand, and will also need to be prepared to provide to other organizations like future employers, the MVA (Motor Vehicle Associate, for a driver’s license), and SSA (Social Security Administration, for your Social Security Number which you need to be paid to work in the US).

The most common documents you will need to use are your:

Passport
Visa
I-20
I-94

If you are employed in the US, you will also complete an I-9 document for each employer you work for.

Read more about the details of your individual documents in this section, so you can make sure you understand the information each one contains."
Social Security Number (SSN),https://isss.umbc.edu/f-1-students/social-security-number/,Social Security Number (SSN) - Main Content,"You are required by law to have a Social Security Number (SSN) in order to be paid for work in the US.  If you are not working in a paid position, you do not need an SSN.  Unfortunately SSN’s are often used as identification numbers for other kinds of applications, such as credit cards or cell phone accounts.  While having an SSN is convenient, you can NOT apply for an SSN unless you have a job offer. If you have received a job offer, follow these steps to apply for an SSN.

 

Step 1: Are you eligible to apply for an SSN?

 

Have you been in the US for at least 10 days?
Is your SEVIS record registered by the ISSS staff?  (must be at least the first day of classes for us to register your record, and you must be enrolled full time)
Do you have a job offer?

If you answered yes to these questions, you are ready to go to the Social Security Administration (SSA) Office to apply for your Social Security Number (SSN).  In order to apply for a social security number (SSN), you will need to visit an office of the SSA in person – you cannot apply by mail or online.

 

Step 2: Applying for your SSN at the SSA

What to take with you:

Valid Passport and visa stamp
Current I-20  (must have most recent I-20 as well as I-20 that was most recently stamped when you entered the US)
I-94 card or printed record (If you did a Change of Status in the US, take your Approval Notice from USCIS, with the I-94 card in the bottom corner)
A Social Security letter from the ISSS office, verifying that you are eligible to be employed
A copy of your assistantship letter or other job offer, OR a letter from your employer (see attached form letter for on-campus employers).
Complete an SSN application at the SSA, or prepare a copy from their website, here.

 

Where to go:

There are multiple SSA locations around UMBC.  You can go to any SSA office you choose.  Please see directions to nearby offices on the back of this form.

Please plan to wait – a trip to the SSA can often take some time, possibly hours.  Be prepared to wait and take something to do while waiting.  Avoid going at the end of their business hours.

 

After you apply:

You should present a copy of the receipt from SSA to your employer.   It will take 2-3 weeks for you to receive your Social Security card in the mail.  When you receive the card, it is important to check the spelling of your name, sign the card and take it to the department where you were hired to complete any necessary paperwork.

Your SSN does not expire or change once it has been issued to you.

 

Need a letter of Ineligibility (usually for the MVA)?  Take the following to an SSA office:

Valid Passport, visa, current I-20, I-94, letter from IES office certifying good F-1 status.

Applying for a Maryland Driver’s License & Getting a State ID,https://isss.umbc.edu/resources/transportation/driving-in-maryland-and-getting-a-state-id/,Applying for a Maryland Driver’s License & Getting a State ID - Main Content,"Important notice

If you are a new student and need to visit the MVA (Motor Vehicle Association), please Contact Us first to make sure that your SEVIS record has been properly registered. This step is imperative to ensure a smooth process at the MVA and avoid any unnecessary delays.

SAVE Verification

To begin the process of obtaining a driver’s license or identification card, you will need to submit an electronic SAVE Verification Request Form online. The form can be accessed using this link.

After submitting the form, a representative from the MVA will contact you within one business week to provide the verification results and information on how to continue the process. If you encounter any difficulties with the form or do not receive a response within the specified timeframe, please contact sdecal@mdot.maryland.gov for assistance.

If you do not complete the SAVE verification in advance, it can still be done in person at the MVA, but this approach carries the risk of delays. If any issues are discovered, you will not be able to complete the process on the same day and will need to schedule another appointment. We highly recommend completing the SAVE verification in advance to avoid any potential delays.

Driver’s License

For more detailed information on obtaining your driver’s license, please review the ISSS Driving in Maryland slide deck.

You can also find directions and requirements on the MVA’s website. For the most accurate list of documents you will need for your appointment, please use the MVA’s Online Document Guide.

State ID card

Maryland State ID cards are a valid form of government-issued identification that can be used to verify your identity. It is recommended for students to have this instead of carrying their official passport. You can apply for the Maryland State ID at an MVA office, but please note that the first step is to complete the SAVE Verification form and receive confirmation before visiting the MVA.

The detailed requirements are listed here.  Please be sure to scroll down to the “New Identification Card” section, and click on the link for the “Online Document Guide” to see what is required in detail.  Under “Sources of Proof,” you will use the first list, for “federally compliant,” which means you have a legal status in the US.

Please note, the first step to apply is to complete the SAVE Verification form and receive confirmation before you visit the MVA.

To apply, you will need to provide the following documents:

Proof of Age and Identity – this can be your passport and other immigration documents.
Proof of Lawful Status – this is your passport, F-1 visa stamp, I-94 record, and most recent Form I-20. If you need to print your I-94 arrival record, you can do so here.
Proof of Social Security Number (SSN) or ineligibility for an SSN – students who don’t have a SSN will need to get a Letter of Ineligibility from the Social Security Administration (SSA) office. Details on how to get this letter can be found here.
Proof of Maryland Residency – You will need to show that you currently live in Maryland by providing two of the items listed in the MVA’s document checklist. The most common include:
A utility bill, such as phone, cable, or internet, showing your name and Maryland address
Checking or Savings account bank statement
Lease agreement for your apartment or house
Credit card bill or statement
Mail sent to you at your address from a government agency
Maryland state tax return from the past year (for students who worked in the US in the past)

There are more options specified on the MVA website, but those listed above are the most common. Once you have completed the SAVE Verification and have all the necessary documents, you can take them to the MVA to apply for your State ID card.

MVA Locations
While there are many MVA locations, the nearest is in Glen Burnie, MD.  You can see the complete list of locations here.  Please note that, unfortunately, the MVA is not easily reached using public transportation.  We recommend either asking a friend who can drive you, or using a taxi or a ride service such as Uber."
Change of Immigration Status,https://isss.umbc.edu/change-of-status/,Change of Immigration Status - Main Content,"Your status in the US is the immigration category you are in while you are in the US for this “stay,” and reflects the intentions you have in the US.  Your status is assigned by your I-94 entry record, and is determined by the category of visa that you have.  Your status also defines what rules you need to follow while in the US – for example, students in F-1 status have to be enrolled full-time, but visitors in B-2 status aren’t allowed to pursue full-time study.  If your purpose for being in the US changes during your time here, you have a few options as to how to change your immigration status.

Read on to learn more about changing your status in the US to F-1 or F-2.

 

Travelling Abroad

You can choose to leave the US, apply for the new appropriate visa type, and return to the US with the new visa.  You will then have a different kind of status in the US.

This option is the fastest method of changing your status, though it may be more expensive as it requires travel abroad.

You do not necessarily have to apply for the new visa category in your home country – many students will apply for a new visa in Canada or other nearby countries.  Please note, you would need to make sure you are allowed to visit this other country, or obtain a visitor visa to enter if necessary.  Wait times for appointments at different US Embassies around the world can be found here.

If you plan to travel abroad to apply for an F-1 visa after being admitted to UMBC, please work with the ISSS office to obtain an I-20 document, which is required for your visa appointment.  Additional information about obtaining an I-20 from UMBC can be found here, and information on scheduling a visa interview and applying for an F-1 visa can be found here.

Students who travel and enter the US with a new F-1 visa MUST notify the ISSS office by submitting a copy of their I-94 record. Please submit a Help Ticket with a copy of your recent I-94 record, and write “Change to F-1 via Travel” as the subject line. Additionally, submit a New Student Arrival Documentation Check-In request in the ISSS Portal. This process is required to register active students in SEVIS.

 

Applying for a Change of Status in the US

You can also choose to remain in the US, and apply to USCIS (US Citizenship and Immigration Services) to change your current status during this stay in the US.  This does not grant you a new visa – you would still need to apply for the new visa type the next time you leave the US, in order to return again.

Some statuses, such as H, allow you to begin  your studies while the change is pending, and others, such as B, do not.  Other benefits, such as different kinds of work authorization, are not available to you until the change is approved.  The change of status application processing time varies, usually taking on average 12 months. Please plan ahead to allow time for this lengthy application process.

As of April 2017, USCIS requires that you maintain your current immigration status until within 30 days of your application approval, for those changing to F-1 or J-1 status.  This means you must be able to stay in your current immigration status until the change to F or J is approved (or more specifically, just before it is approved), regardless of how long it takes.  For individuals whose existing status is not valid for at least 12 months, ISSS strongly recommends working with an immigration lawyer on your change of status application.

 To request a change to your current immigration status in the US, you will need to submit an application and supporting documents to USCIS.  The processing fee that USCIS charges is $455 (this includes the $370 filing fee and the $85 biometrics fee). Note that there is also an additional $350 SEVIS fee that is required if you will have an I-20 for the first time (for change of status to F-1 student only).  For changes to F-1 status, the international office of the school you plan to attend may be able to help you prepare the application package.

A few weeks after submitting your application, you should receive a paper receipt in the mail at the address you specified on your application.  This receipt will include a reference number specific to your application, which must be used when contacting USCIS about your case.  You can follow the progress of your application on the web at http://www.uscis.gov/, under “Check Your Case Status.” Eventually your approval notice will be mailed to you at the address you gave on your application, and will have a new paper I-94 attached, indicating your new status in the US and the duration of time you can remain in the US with that new status.  Your electronic I-94 record should also be automatically updated appropriately.

Once your change of status has been approved, you will be in legal F-1 status within the U.S.  However, if you leave the country and do not have a valid F-1 visa in your passport, you will need to apply for and obtain the appropriate visa stamp at a U.S. Embassy or consulate before returning to the U.S.  Your visa type determines your status when you enter the US.

The ISSS Office strongly encourages potential change of status applicants to discuss the timing and process options of your application with our office before taking any action!  While we can help with basic advising, please note that our office is not a immigration law firm and this application is between you and USCIS.  We can try our best to help, but our assistance is NOT legal advice.  Complex cases will be strongly encouraged to work with an immigration lawyer to help ensure a smooth application process, and all cases should consider this option.

 

Information for changes to F-1 from specific categories that have unique concerns:

Change from B-2 Visitor to F-1 student:  If you entered the U.S. on a B-2 visa (tourist status) and are applying for F-1 student status, there is very strong chance that your request to change to F-1 will be denied.  The exception to this would be if your B-2 visa is marked as “prospective student.”   You are NOT allowed to attend classes while in B-2 status, except if those classes are “recreational or non-vocational.”  B-2 applicants also have the additional burden of maintaining their B-2 status until their change to F-1 is approved, which often means applying for a B-2 extension.  ISSS does not have the expertise to assist in this process in any way.

Change from F-2 dependent to F-1 student: F-2 individuals are not able to attend school full-time, and must have an approved change of status to F-1 before beginning their full-time studies at UMBC.  As of Summer 2014, F-2 students can attend school part-time.

Change from J-1 or J-2 to F-1 student:  Immigration regulations do NOT allow a person in J-1 or J-2 status to change to a new status while in the US if they are subject to the 212(e) 2 year return requirement.  However, someone subject to 212(e) in one of these statuses can leave the US to apply for an F-1 visa and return to the US in F-1 status.  Please be aware that gaining an F-1 visa abroad and returning in F-1 status will NOT remove the obligation of the two-year home residency requirement, though this can be postponed until after your F-1 studies and possible OPT are complete. You will need to request a waiver from your home government or the agency that is sponsoring you to avoid the 2 year return requirement.  For more information on the 2 year requirement, please read more here, about 2/3 down the page.

J-1 or J-2 individuals that are NOT subject to 212(e) home residency requirements are eligible to change their status in the US.  You can determine if you are subject by checking your J-1 or J-2 visa stamp or on your DS-2019.

Change from A or G to F-1 student: An I-566 form must be completed with your primary G or A visa holder’s employer before submitting a change of status application.  This form can take some time, so please plan ahead.

 

SEVIS FEE Requirement for a change to F-1 status

 If you are changing to F-1 status, you will need to pay a one-time $350 fee known as the SEVIS Fee.  This fee must be paid in advance of submitting your application to USCIS, as you will need to include your fee receipt with your application.

You can pay this fee on-line by filling out the online Form I-901 and using a credit card at www.fmjfee.com.  An online receipt can be printed from this website and submitted as proof of payment.  A SEVIS number is required to pay the SEVIS fee.  Your SEVIS number can be found on your I-20, in the top right corner.

Internships and International Students,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/internships-and-international-students/,Eligibility,"To be eligible for CPT, an F-1 international student must:

complete a full academic year of full-time study physically present at a US university.
an academic year is defined as two semesters, not including summer or winter sessions.
ISSS recognizes previous semesters of full-time enrollment, even if undertaken in a different immigration status, such as H-4, or at a different school or degree level in F-1 status.  Previous enrollment cannot satisfy this requirement if the student has left the US and returned with a different SEVIS ID number.
be offered a paid position that is directly related to their UMBC degree program
Unpaid positions do not require CPT authorization, but a student may still choose to apply for CPT for an unpaid experience.
CPT can only be approved for one semester or session at a time."
Internships and International Students,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/internships-and-international-students/,Application Process,"Requirements

Immigration regulations describe CPT as work that is “established as part of the curriculum” of study. The CPT application is designed to show that the work being done meets this requirement. Three pieces of information are required to provide this proof:

Proof of employment opportunity: A copy of your job offer letter from the position you intend to undertake on CPT.
Proof that the work is related to your academic program:  The CPT application asks the student to describe how the job is related to their academic program. The student’s academic advisor must confirm that the job is related to the degree program by completing the required electronic recommendation form.  Graduate students must also get the approval of their Graduate Program Director (GPD) through the ISSS Portal.
Proof that the work will be recorded on your academic record: To ensure that the work experience is part of the curriculum, students must enroll either in academic credit or the Internship Success Practicum (PRAC), either of which will appear on the student’s UMBC transcript.
Academic credit requires enrollment in, and payment for, regular academic credit, such as an internship credit or independent study approved by the academic advisor.
“PRAC” is the Intern Success Practicum managed by the Career Center.  PRAC does not have any academic credits associated with it; rather it is a non-credit transcript notation. As such, it has no cost, but it also cannot be used to satifsy full-time enrollment requirements. PRAC appears on the transcript with a pass/fail grade and has minimal requirements to participate.
Read more and enroll in PRAC here.  Remember to allow five business days for your PRAC enrollment to be approved by the Career Center.

ISSS cannot approve CPT for dates in the past. You will only be authorized for CPT once your complete application is submitted, approved by ISSS, and a new Form I-20 is issued.

*It is absolutely imperative that CPT is approved before you being your work experience, or before you continue an existing job whose CPT authorization is expiring!  You are not legally allowed to work in the US without active CPT authorization on your Form I-20.  While employers might not notice and might hire you or allow you to continue working after the CPT expires, these kinds of discrepancies could cause you very significant problems in later immigration applications, such as H-1b or Permanent Resident applications.  Please take responsibility for your immigration status and make sure you are aware of the end of your CPT authorization. Working without proper authorization in the US will cause you to lose your immigration status."
Internships and International Students,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/internships-and-international-students/,Submitting your CPT Application,"Login to your ISSS Portal 
Click on “Search Forms” in the top right corner of the page
Choose the relevant request – Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
Read the directions and complete all sections of the application
Please note that CPT often requires enrollment in the Career Center’s “Internship Success Practicum (PRAC).”  Please upload the email confirmation of your enrollment to meet this requirement.
NOTE: If you are using PRAC, do NOT submit your application until your PRAC is approved and you are able to upload your PRAC approval email.
The application requires the support of your academic advisor.  Please follow the directions under the “Recommendations” section to invite your advisor to provide their support electronically.  For Graduate Students, you will need to do the process a second time to get your Graduate Program Director (GPD)’s approval as well.
Only click submit after you have uploaded all requirements.
NOTE: Once you have invited your academic advisor (all students) and GPD (graduate students only), you can submit the application without waiting for the recommendations to be completed.
ISSS advisors will review your application and contact you within 2-3 business days after your advisor (and GPD, if applicable) recommendation is received."
Internships and International Students,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/internships-and-international-students/,Deadlines,"Deadlines for the CPT application depend on how the experience will appear on your transcript.

Academic Credit

The deadline to enroll in academic credit for CPT is the same as the regular deadline to enroll in any courses each semester.

The deadlines for each semester and session can be found here.

Internship Success Practicum (PRAC)

These deadlines vary by semester, and should be verified with the Career Center, but are typically near the following dates:

Fall semester: approximately October 1
Winter session: approximately January 2
Spring semester: approximately March 1
Summer Session I or II: approximately July 1"
Internships and International Students,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/internships-and-international-students/,Full-Time vs. Part-Time CPT,"CPT can be approved as part-time (maximum 20 hours per week or less) or full-time (more than 20 hours per week).

Part-time CPT  is not limited, and can be used as many semesters or sessions as a student likes, as long as it is approved for each new semester or session.

Full-time CPT is limited to a maximum of 12 months total throughout your degree program.  There are no consequences for full-time CPT use up to 12 months, but after 12 months of approved full-time CPT, the student is no longer eligible for OPT post-graduation work.

Full-time CPT can only be approved in the following instances:

During a summer or winter session when course enrollment is not required
In a student’s last semester before graduation, as long as they are enrolled in 4 or fewer credits.
For graduate students enrolled only in research credits (e.g. 898 or 899) and who have completed all their other coursework."
Internships and International Students,https://dil.umbc.edu/resources/internships-and-international-students/,CPT and Taxes,"Paid work in the US is almost always taxed.  Your employer’s Human Resources (HR) staff will work with you to review your immigration and personal identifying documents to ensure that you are allowed to work in the US (including your I-20 with the CPT authorization on it), and will help you complete tax forms for the money you will earn working for them.

Typically, your employer will ask you to complete a Form I-9, which verifies your authorization to work in the US, and a W-4 form, that indicates how taxes will be withheld from your paycheck. You can read more about these documents here.

Please note: International students are usually exempt from paying certain kinds of taxes, namely Social Security and Medicare taxes.  You can reference this law to employers here.  However, if an individual has been in the US more than 5 years, they usually become a “resident for tax purposes,” and their tax rates change to include these additional tax categories."
OPT and OPT STEM Information,https://isss.umbc.edu/opt-and-opt-stem-information/,OPT and OPT STEM Information - Main Content,"Students who plan on working in a paid position after completing their program must receive work authorization. OPT (Optional Practical Training) is a type of work permission available for F-1 international students who finish their program requirements. OPT is approved by U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS), with support from the university ISSS office. Students who are approved for OPT can work 1 year in unpaid/paid positions after completing their major program of study.

OPT follows federal and school regulations:

OPT must be related to the student’s major program of study.
Students must receive an OPT I-20 from the ISSS office before submitting their application to USCIS.
OPT is granted only once per education level.
Once approved by USCIS:
Students are approved for 1 year of work authorization.
Students cannot begin working before the start date on their Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card.
Students must work a combined total of at least 20 hours/week.
Positions can be unpaid/paid and with multiple employers.

Students should plan ahead and begin the application process with the ISSS office as early as possible.

Eligibility

To be eligible for OPT, students must meet following criteria:

Currently enrolled at UMBC full time with active F-1 status
Completed two consecutive academic semesters (fall and spring) in the US
Completed all program requirements for degree
Exceptions for graduate students who only have a thesis/dissertation remaining
Have not been previously granted OPT at the current level of study
Have not been approved for 12 months or more of full time Curricular Practical Training (CPT)

 

Application Process

Students must first receive a special OPT I-20 from the ISSS office before submitting their OPT application to USCIS. Applications submitted to USCIS without an OPT-specific I-20 will be denied. USCIS processing times can take up to three months or more, so students should plan ahead and apply early. Contact our office about any concerns or questions.

 

Application Submission Period

OPT applications must be submitted to USCIS no earlier than 90 days before your program end date and no later than 60 days after your program end date. OPT applications submitted to USCIS outside of this date range will be denied. Work with the ISSS office to prepare your application early.

 

Step 1: Request your OPT I-20

Students must first request a special OPT I-20 from the ISSS office. Applications submitted to USCIS without an OPT I-20 will be denied.

Students must submit a complete OPT request in the ISSS Portal. First, students choose an OPT start date. The OPT start date can be any date within the 60 days after the I-20 program end date. Please refer to the table and/or graphic above to choose an OPT start date.

Second, students will need to upload a draft I-765. Students should download a draft I-765 by clicking “View Draft Snapshot” in their online USCIS account. Students who upload a draft I-765 with the incorrect format will need to re-upload it in the correct format.

ISSS will review each student’s OPT request and send an email if anything is missing. Once approved, students will receive an I-20 with the OPT recommendation listed on the second page. The I-20 should list “OPT Requested” on the second page, with requested start and end dates. Please contact us if anything needs to be corrected.

To do’s:

Watch a previous OPT Workshop presentation (requires myUMBC login) and review the slides
Download a draft I-765 application
Submit a complete OPT request in the ISSS Portal

Remember: you do not need a job offer before applying!

 

Step 2: Submit I-765 OPT Application to USCIS

The ISSS office will review each OPT request and email the student about any potential edits students should change on their draft I-765. Students will also be able to view their OPT I-20 in their request. Students must print out and sign their OPT I-20 with ink. Submitting an application without a signature will likely result in a denial. Finally, students must upload all required documentation and submit their I-765 application using the USCIS online application system. The current fee for submitting an I-765 is $410. The fee is increasing to $470 and will go into effect on April 1, 2024.


 

USCIS Online Application Step-by-Step Guide
OPT Checklist

BEFORE YOU SUBMIT: Double check to see if “OPT Requested” with the requested start and end dates is on the second page of your I-20! If you submit your OPT application to USCIS without this OPT I-20, it will be automatically denied!

 

Step 3: Track Case Status

After submitting an application to USCIS, students will receive an I-797 Receipt Notice with a case number. Students can track the status of their application by entering their case number on the USCIS Case Status website. USCIS processing times vary, and it can take up to three months to receive a response on an application. Check current USCIS processing times for an I-765 application.

Step 4: Review Response from USCIS

Students will receive a response from USCIS on their I-765 OPT application. Students will either receive a Request for Evidence (RFE) notice, approval notice, or denial notice. These different outcomes are outlined below:

 

RFE
Students who receive an RFE should contact the ISSS office as soon as possible. ISSS will assist the student in preparing additional documentation. Most students will not receive this, but please contact our office if you do.

 

Denial
Students who are denied should review the explanation written on their notice. Students can request another OPT I-20 and submit a new I-765 application if their 60 day grace period has not ended. Contact the ISSS office about any questions or concerns.

 

Approval
The approval notice will list the approved OPT start and end dates. However, students cannot begin working until their physical EAD card arrives in the mail. Students can track the delivery of their EAD card by following these instructions.

 

Step 5: Maintain F-1 Status After OPT Approval

On the approved start date, students will receive an email from do-not-reply.SEVP@ice.dhs.gov to create an SEVP Portal Account. Students must create an account and update their employer information while on OPT to maintain F-1 status. Any changes to employer information or a student’s address must be entered within 10 days. Students who cannot enter information into their SEVP Portal Account should contact the ISSS office.

 

It is your responsibility to maintain F-1 status on OPT!

Follow these regulations:


Update your address and any employer information in the SEVP Portal within 10 days of the change
Do not delete any employers – this is for record keeping
Work unpaid/paid position(s) for a combined total of at least 20 hours/week
Must be related to your major program of study
Can be multiple employers
Keep track of your unemployment days
Students have a total of 90 unemployment days while on OPT
